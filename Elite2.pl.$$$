The HVG is used primarily in a ground-combat role against armoured vehicles, defensive emplacements and heavily armoured soldiers.  Due to the spray area of the flechettes, it is not recommended that this weapon be used in populated areas.";}

It fires micronized compressed-explosive shells, approximately 14cm long and 5cm in diameter, each possessing an explosive force equivalent to about half a kilogram of TNT. As a result of the combination of RoF (Rate of Fire) and explosive potential, the Repeater Cannon is an extremely dangerous weapon.";}
if (@EliteArray[4] eq "Homing Laser")  	   {$WeaponStats = "Homing lasers are potent weapons, comprised of three major components; a sensor suite, repositionable emitter, and a charge containment device.  After acquiring a target, the wielder has to merely keep the weapon pointed in the general direction of the target, and the sensor suite automatically calculates all necessary changes in aim, including repositioning caused by the user moving.";}
if (@EliteArray[4] eq "Plasma Assaulter")  {$WeaponStats = "Plasma Assaulters fire a component shell consisting of an armour-piercing tip, and a plasma packet.  When the shell strikes a surface, the AP tip shreds through the outer armour later, and at the same time, initiates a chemical reaction to turn the plasma packet into a super-heated gas.  This gas enters the target through the damaged armour, literally vapourizing everything it comes in contact with.  Test results have shown that flesh liquifies within 3 seconds.";}
if (@EliteArray[4] eq "Micro-Missile Cannon")  {$WeaponStats = "Micro-Missile Cannons are essentially miniaturized bazookas with an enhanced payload and capable of carrying multiple rounds, and are fired as one would use an assault rifle.  The missiles themselves are approximately one-tenth the size of a bazooka round, and the launcher is capable of carrying a payload of 15 rounds.  Despite the small clip size, MMC's are popular weapons, due to the fact that a variety of missiles can be used, including high-explosive, guided, heat-seaking and anti-radar.";}

Sonic waves are emitted in a tightly focussed beam, literally vibrating its target apart.  The emitted waves are so powerful that the environment they are discharged into can be seen to shake as the wave passes through them.";}
if (@EliteArray[4] eq "Fusion Rifle")	   {$WeaponStats = "Contrary to popular belief, this weapon does not fire shells which cause fusion explosions upon detonation, primarily due to the NBT (Nuclear Ban Treaty) of 2197.  Rather, the fusion detonation is contained within the weapon itself, the resulting explosion used to project a solid tri-alloy slug at well over mach 20.  There is currently no known armoured substance powerful enough to resist even a single round fired from this weapon.";}

Technically classified as a heavy-artillery weapon, it is nevertheless portable enough to be carried and fired as a modern assault rifle.  By adjusting the amount of anti-matter fired, the weilder can adapt this weapon so that it is safe to use in close-range combat.";}

Copying the basic concept of medieval armour, arms designers have combined light-weight metals with high-density ceramics to create a very light-weight personal body armour which is very resistant to thermal and armour-piercing effects.  Concussion weapons have a slightly greater than normal effect on this armour however.";}

By interacting subtley with the armour, the wearer is able to control the exact force of the armour, which can range from the softest touch to rending titanium blast plating in the matter of an instant.  The MES has the unfortunate side-effect of increasing user fatigue, so prolonged combat operations become much more difficult.";}

Additionally, Blast Armour incorporates a multitude of features designed to reduce user fatigue and stress, tasks at which it succeeds quite admirably.  This armour is Environmentally Sealed, allowing soldiers equiped with it to operate in scenarios which would otherwise be extremely dangerous, if not leathal.";}
